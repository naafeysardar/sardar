Things to do

1\. Use gasoline prices for the analysis in addition to oil prices. The
gasoline price measure should be the same as used by Baumeister and Kilian
since we are motivating our analysis with their work. For now, we can
use just the price of gasoline deflated by the core CPI (FRED series
CPILFESL).

2\. The other line of work that motivates our analysis is by Auerbach and
Gorodnochenko. They do not use NBER recessions and expansions to divide
the data into regimes. Instead, they construct a measure of the state of
the economy. We should use that same measure. It may take a while to
figure out how to construct it, but it is described in their papers.
We should also estimate a STVAR model in addition to the threshold model.
That should be an easy extension.

3\. The paper looks at asymmetric predictions over the business cycle
only for 1-step ahead models. We need to consider h-step ahead models,
the same as the local projections models, for up to one year forecast
horizons.

4\. Kilian and Vigfusson (2013) "Do Oil Prices Help Forecast U.S. Real 
GDP? The Role of Nonlinearities and Asymmetries" claim that the net oil
price change model predicts output better than the net oil price increase
model. We should consider that model in addition to the NOPI model.

5\. We need to remove the effect of oil demand shocks from the energy
price series we are using. That should be done using the approach of
Kilian (2009, *AER*). He provides the REA index series on his website.
