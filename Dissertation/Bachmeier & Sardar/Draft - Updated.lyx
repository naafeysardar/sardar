\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing double
\noindent
A key question in macroeconomics is how aggregate consumption responds to
 a shock to gasoline expenditures.
 Using a structural VAR model for U.S.
 data covering the period 1973-2018, this paper shows that (i) an increase
 in gasoline expenditures reduces aggregate consumption, (ii) the response
 to a gasoline expenditures shock is much stronger in a recession than in
 an expansion, and (iii) the asymmetry in response over the business cycle
 is primarily due to differences in household savings behavior in recessions
 versus expansions.
 Our results are consistent with the literature showing larger effects of
 fiscal policy in recessions.

 Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important question in macroeconomics is how aggregate consumption responds
 to a shock to gasoline expenditures.
 In one sense, the mechanism by which consumption is affected is straightforward.
 If gasoline consumption is inelastic in the short run, a positive shock
 to the price of gasoline will lead to higher gasoline expenditures, crowding
 out spending on other goods and services.

For empirical evidence on the response of consumption to gasoline and oil
 price shocks, see Bernanke (1983), Hamilton (1988), Pindyck (1991), Bernanke
 (2006) , Hamilton (2009), Edelstein and Kilian (2009), Hamilton (2016),
 Kilian and Baumeister (2016), Kilian et.
 al.
 (2018), Herrera et al.
 (2019), Gorodnichenko et al.

\end_inset

 Consumers will have to decide whether to continue buying the same amount
 of gasoline at the higher price, in which case there will be less discretionary
 income available for other expenditures (Hamilton, 2009).
 Higher gasoline expenditures have an indirect effect on consumption, as
 the demand for goods that complement gasoline in consumption, most notably
 automobiles, will fall (Hamilton, 1988).
 A recent study by Farrell and Greig (2015) concluded that the marginal
 propensity to consume non-energy goods out of a dollar saved on gasoline
 is roughly 0.8.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another channel by which energy shocks can affect consumption is increasing
 uncertainty about future energy prices.
 In the presence of uncertainty, consumers have an incentive to delay purchases
 of durable goods such as cars and houses (Bernanke, 1983; Pindyck, 1991).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Gicheva et.
 al.
 (2008) use scanner data to infer that as gasoline expenditures rise, consumers
 shift towards groceries as opposed to eating out in order to offset this
 increase.
 This is also followed by switching to lower cost grocery items.

Figure 1 represents consumer spending on gasoline and non-gasoline goods
 as a share of total consumption expenditures.
 Gasoline share of consumption peaked during the early 1980's when households
 were spending almost 6% of their total consumption expenditures on gasoline
 goods and services.
 Since the 1980s, the gasoline share of consumption has considerably gone
 down due to reasons like vehicle-fuel efficiency.
 Low and stable global oil prices throughout the 1990s meant that the share
 of gasoline expenditures was low, whereas the share of non-gasoline spending
 was relatively higher compared to the previous decade.
 This figure suggests that gasoline and non-gasoline consumptions move in
 the opposite direction, with an increase in gasoline expenditures reducing
 discretionary income and decreasing non-gasoline spending.

 Increases in gasoline expenditures have historically caused a transfer
 of U.S.
 income to foreign oil producers.
 Thus, higher gasoline expenditures have the same effect as a tax on the
 U.S.
 economy, and should be expected to reduce aggregate consumption.

In the words of Janet Yellen, "Higher oil prices lower American income overall
 because the United States is a major oil importer and hence much of the
 proceeds are transferred abroad.

 Thus, an increase in the price of crude oil acts like a tax on U.S.
 households, and .
 .
 .tends to have a dampening effect on consumer spending.

 in retail gasoline prices.

 and hence tends to exert a significant drag on consumer spending.,"

This paper tests for an asymmetric response of consumption to gasoline expenditu
re shocks across recessions and expansions.
 The motivation for our analysis is the recent literature showing that the
 impact of fiscal policy depends on the state of the economy.
 Tagkalakis (2008) finds that tax cuts increase consumption by more in recession
s as opposed to expansions.
 Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) estimate that fiscal multipliers range
 from 1-1.5 in recessions and 0-0.5 in expansions.
 Jorda and Taylor (2016) find that fiscal austerity depresses the economy
 more when implemented in a slump as opposed to a boom.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If shocks to gasoline expenditures have the same effect as a change in taxes,
 and fiscal policy has different effects in recessions and expansions, it
 follows that the effect of a gasoline expenditure shock should also depend
 on the state of the business cycle.
 A finding of economically meaningful nonlinearity of this type would require
 a change to empirical and theoretical macroeconomic models that include
 energy prices.
 The analysis would also emphasize the need for the Federal Reserve to consider
 asymmetries in the impact of gasoline expenditure shocks across recessions
 and expansions when it is forecasting consumption, as failure to do so
 might result in misleading conclusions about the effect of gasoline expenditure
s shock on the U.S.
 economy.
 On the other hand, a failure to find evidence of this type of nonlinearity
 would cast doubt on the treatment of a gasoline expenditure shock as a
 change in taxes, claims that the effect of fiscal policy depends on the
 state of the economy, or both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by documenting the impact of gasoline expenditure shock on non-gasoline
 goods and services.
 Consistent with expectations and the existing literature, we find that
 a positive shock to gasoline expenditures is followed by reduced spending
 on other goods.

 year (approximately $200)

The average household income before taxes for 2017 was $73,572, of which
 $60,060 was used by households for consumption expenditures.
 These numbers are derived from the latest Consumer Expenditure Survey released
 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year 2017.
 Based on our sample, gasoline is on average 3.3% of consumption expenditures.
 Consumers on average spend $2000 on gasoline and other energy goods in
 a year.
 A 10% increase raises gasoline expenditures by $200 for the year.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then redo the analysis using a threshold (nonlinear) model that allows
 the response to gasoline expenditure shocks to be different in expansions
 and recessions.
 We establish the presence of an asymmetric response of consumption to an
 increase in gasoline expenditures between the two states of the economy.
 Following a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures for any year (about $200),
 total non-gasoline spending for an average household goes down by $1,545
 in recessions and $383 in expansions over the same time period.
 The motor vehicles sector is responsible for driving a big proportion of
 the response.
 Spending on motor vehicles goes down by $345 per household in recessions
 as opposed to $85 in expansions over the same time period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Kilian and Edelstein (2009), one of the mechanisms through
 which higher gasoline prices reduce discretionary income is the precautionary
 savings effect.
 As gasoline prices increase, consumers become uncertain about the future
 path of the economy and further reduce their consumption in order to increase
 precautionary savings.
 These savings act as an insurance against a greater likelihood of future
 unemployment and future income losses.
 We present evidence that the difference in the response of consumption
 is driven by an asymmetric response of personal savings to gasoline expenditure
 shocks across recessions and expansions.
 Following a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures over the course of a
 year (approximately $200), private savings for an average household increase
 by $398 in recessions as opposed to $60 in expansions.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Based on the savings rate across our sample, an average household saved
 $5,929 during 2017.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This suggests that as gasoline expenditures increase, households increase
 their precautionary savings because they perceive a higher chance of future
 income losses with the response of savings stronger in recessions.
 As gasoline expenditures increase, households increase precautionary savings
 by more in recessions as opposed to expansions and the resulting drop in
 consumption is higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our analysis further investigates whether gasoline expenditure shocks affect
 consumption differently depending on whether they are positive versus negative
 shocks.
 We find that negative gasoline expenditure shocks have large positive effects
 on consumption with the impact being amplified in recessions.
 This suggests that a decrease in gasoline expenditures is more effective
 in boosting private consumption during recessions as opposed to expansions.
 Households consume the extra income generated following unanticipated decreases
 in gasoline expenditures.

The paper proceeds as follows.
 Section 2 describes the methodology for the linear VAR model and its results.
 This section displays the impulse response functions to gasoline expenditure
 increases.
 Section 3 discusses how we model the difference in response across recessions
 and expansions.
 Discussion of results and the motivation for asymmetry is also included.
 Section 4 looks at the forecasting implications of our results, with a
 discussion about why the Federal Reserve's consumption forecasting models
 need to consider asymmetries.
 In section 5, we present robustness checks in which we use alternative
 recession dates and a different measure of shock.
 Section 6 looks at the response of consumption to decreases in gasoline
 expenditures.
 Section 7 concludes.

 The chosen lag order is larger than the estimates suggested by Schwarz

 Gasoline expenditures are defined as real personal consumption expenditures

 The four measures of consumption growth we use are real personal consumption
 expenditures (RPCE), RPCE: Services, RPCE: Nondurables, and RPCE: Durables.
 Estimation of the linear VAR model does not represent an original contribution,
 but it provides a benchmark for comparison with the results of the nonlinear

 To calculate our measure of total consumption, we subtract nominal consumption
 expenditures on gasoline and other energy goods (NIPA Table 2.3.5, Line 11)
 from total nominal consumption expenditures (NIPA Table 2.3.5, Line 1).
 This is followed by deflating it using the 
\emph on
Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures
\emph default
 (NIPA Table 2.3.4, Line 1), and expressing it in real terms.
 The other categories of consumption, namely durables (NIPA Table 2.3.5, Line
 3), nondurables (NIPA Table 2.3.5, Line 8) and services (NIPA Table 2.3.5,
 Line 13) undergo a similar transformation.
 Table 3 presents the results of various stationary and unit root tests
 performed on real consumption series variables in levels and percentage

 We also report the Elliot, Rothenberg and Stock (1996) modified Dicky Fuller

 Panel A suggests that the real consumption variables are non-stationery
 in levels since we fail to reject the null (

 In panel B, we see that the percentage differences for our real consumption

 As a result, our measures of consumption are expressed in percentage change
 throughout the course of the paper.

\begin_layout Standard
The impulse response functions are identified by assuming the consumption
 shock does not have a contemporaneous effect on gasoline expenditures,
 which implies a recursive system with gasoline expenditures ordered first.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is similar to the identification in Edelstein and Kilian (2009).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 One metric for judging the plausibility of our assumption that gasoline
 expenditures do not respond immediately to consumption shocks (or other
 macroeconomic shocks that have an effect on consumption) is to look at
 the contemporaneous correlations of the VAR residuals.
 If gasoline expenditures are reacting immediately to macroeconomic shocks,
 it will cause a positive correlation between the two residuals.
 On the other hand, if consumption expenditures are reacting to gasoline
 expenditures, the correlation will be negative.
 The correlations are reported in Table 1.
 In all cases, the correlations are negative, ranging from -0.07 to -0.45.
 This does not confirm that our identification is correct, but it is consistent
 with our ordering of the variables, and we can rule out a recursive VAR
 with consumption ordered first.

What is the structural shock to gasoline expenditures capturing? The obvious,
 and almost certainly most important, source of gasoline expenditure shocks
 is an unanticipated change in the price of gasoline.
 Other sources of gasoline expenditure shocks include changes in preferences
 for larger or smaller vehicles, changes in travel patterns such as those
 witnessed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and changes in
 commuting behavior due to fluctuations in house prices.

 Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The responses of the four consumption series to a gasoline expenditures
 shock are found in Figure 3.
 As mentioned earlier, an increase in gasoline expenditures can explain
 a shift in consumption from energy to non-energy goods, but not necessarily
 a change in the 
\emph on
level of aggregate consumption
\emph default
.
 Our total PCE measure consists of consumption expenditures on all goods
 and services except gasoline.
 Using such a measure will help us understand how non-gasoline consumption
 responds to a change in gasoline expenditures.
 When gasoline expenditures increase, total consumption (non-gasoline) decreases
 right away.
 In the long run, total consumption expenditures decrease by around 0.7%
 and the effect is statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval.
 As expenditures increase, durables PCE decrease by around 1.6% after the
 first year.
 The response, however, is also significant at the 95% confidence interval.
 The effect on nondurables (less gasoline) and services PCE is not as amplified
 as durables since the demand for such categories is relatively inelastic
 as opposed to durable goods.
 A year after the shock nondurables PCE decreases by 0.35%.
 Services PCE falls down by 0.5% in the long run.

 Figure 4 decomposes the response of total consumption into contributions
 made by different sectors.
 The contribution was calculated by accounting for the weight of durables,
 nondurables and services.
 This was followed by multiplying it with the estimates at each time horizon.
 Almost half of the drop in consumption is explained by the services sector.
 Durables contribute to almost one-third of the drop in RPCE, while nondurables
 play only a minor role.
 Thus, in order to explain the reaction of aggregate consumption, we need
 to focus on services and durables consumption.

Figures 11 and 12 present the response of various consumption series to
 an increase in gasoline expenditures.
 We find that the decline in motor vehicles CE is 2.78% in response to a
 10% increase in gasoline expenditures after a year.
 Spending on furnishing and durable household equipment decreases by almost
 1% at the end of the year.
 The effect is statistically significance at the 95% confidence bands.
 Consumption expenditure on other durables marginally decreases but the
 effect is not statistically significant.
 Food PCE initially decreases in response to consumers' spending more on
 gasoline and other energy goods.
 In the long run, however, spending on food returns to its original level.
 Consumption expenditure on household services and other nondurables decreases
 marginally and the effect is statistically significant as well.

In dollar terms, a $200 annual increase in gasoline expenditures will force
 an average household to reduce spending on motor vehicles by $82 over the
 course of a year.
 Spending on furnishings and other durable household equipment and clothing
 goes down by $16 and $10 respectively.
 Food spending initially goes down $12 but returns to its original level
 by the end a year.
 Spending on motor vehicle services decreases in response to gasoline expenditur
e shocks.
 Consumer spending on public transportation increases by $9 over the same
 time period.
 There are two reasons for this increase.
 First, rising gasoline expenditures increases the fares consumers pay for
 public transport.
 Second, higher gasoline expenditures mean that the cost of operating cars
 goes up, which might force some consumers to abandon the usage of their
 personal vehicles and shift to public transport.
 Money spent by consumers on food services and accommodation goes down by
 $12 over the entire year.
 This category includes money spent on vacations and food away from home.
 As gasoline expenditures increase, the average household faces budgetary
 constraints and has to cut down on holidays and other leisure.
 Expenditures on housing go down by $57.
 This suggests that consumers might be forced to switch to low-cost housing
 in response to higher gasoline expenditures.
 A $200 increase in gasoline expenditures over the course of a year increases
 utility bills by $11 per household.
 Spending on other services (communication, education, legal etc) decreases
 by $23 whereas healthcare spending goes down by $35.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are in line Edelstein and Kilian (2009) which suggests that
 spending on non-gasoline goods and services goes down in response to rising
 gasoline expenditures.
 As gasoline expenditures increase, consumers’ discretionary income goes
 down since they have less to spend on other goods and services, resulting
 in a drop across most of the consumption categories.
 Results from the linear model results are that the response of goods for
 which the demand is relatively elastic (durables) is significantly more
 than goods for which the demand is relatively inelastic (nondurables).

 Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impulse responses of different measures of consumption to gasoline expenditu
re shocks in recessions and expansions are calculated using local projections.
 Local projections have the ability to accommodate non-linear specification
 (Jorda, 2005).
 The key advantage of using a nonlinear model instead of estimating a VAR
 for each regime is that with the latter we do not have enough observations
 to make a precise analysis.
 In our case, the observations for a recessionary regime only comprise 20%
 of the entire sample.
 As a result, our estimates of the VAR model for recessions would not have
 been precise due to insufficient observations.
 Estimating a non-linear model allows us to utilize the entire dataset for
 our inference.

The motor vehicles sector is responsible for driving a big proportion of
 the response.
 Spending on motor vehicles goes down by $345 per household in recessions
 as opposed to $85 in expansions over the course of a year.
 There are various reasons for this large drop in consumer spending on motor
 vehicles.
 First, is what Kilian and Edelstein (2009) call the 
\emph on
uncertainty effect
\emph default
.
 Consumers postpone their purchases because motor vehicles represent big-ticket
 items and will only be bought when they are confident that they can afford
 them.
 Second, credit constraints and uncertainty during recessions forces consumers
 to reduce spending on consumer durables more aggressively.
 Other categories of consumption also show statistically significant asymmetry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not see a one-to one relationship between gasoline expenditures and
 non-gasoline spending.
 The decrease in non-gasoline spending is larger than the increase in gasoline

 consumers to increase their precautionary savings.

When purchase decisions are reversible, consumption may fall in response
 to energy price shocks, as consumers increase their precautionary savings.
 This response will arise if consumers smooth their consumption because
 they perceive a greater likelihood of future unemployment and hence future
 income losses.

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Personal savings rate is defined as the proportion of household income that

\end_layout

\end_inset

 as the dependent variable to investigate whether consumers save more during
 recessions as opposed to expansions following a shock to gasoline expenditures.
 The estimates from our model suggest that a 10% increase in gasoline expenditur
es over the course of a year increases the savings rate by 0.54% in recessions
 as opposed to 0.08% in expansions.
 In dollar terms, a $200 increase in gasoline expenditures over the course
 of a year increases private savings for an average household by $398 in
 recessions as opposed to $60 in expansions.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Based on the average savings rate across our sample, consumers saved $5,929
 during 2017.
 Savings increase to $6232 in recessions and $6033 during expansions over

\end_layout

\end_inset

 This suggests that as gasoline expenditures increase, households increase
 their savings because they perceive a higher chance of future income losses,
 with the response of savings being stronger in recessions.
 As gasoline expenditures increase, households increase savings by more
 in recessions as opposed to expansions and the resulting drop in consumption
 is higher.

 Response of Gasoline Expenditures to Own Shock
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 16 shows the response of gasoline expenditures
\series bold
 
\series default
to its own shock in recessions and expansions.
 Following the initial increase of 10%, gasoline expenditures decrease in
 recessions and increase in expansions.
 This suggests that there is evidence of asymmetry in the response of gasoline
 expenditures to own shock which then feeds through to create asymmetry
 in the responses of consumption as well.
 Table 2 compares the response of gasoline expenditures and personal savings
 rate to a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures.
 In recessions, gasoline expenditures increase by 2.98% one quarter after
 the shock.
 This increase is due to the inelastic nature of gasoline expenditures in
 the short run.
 However, two quarters after the shock consumers reduce spending on gasoline
 goods and services in recessions, which frees up a portion of their income
 and consequently increases savings as evident from Table 2.

To help us understand why the response of gasoline expenditures to its own
 shock varies across the state of the economy, we look at the responses
 of gasoline consumption by sectors and the real price of gasoline.
 Data on gasoline consumption series by sector was downloaded from the Energy
 Information Administration website.
 The real price of gasoline was calculated by obtaining the average gasoline
 price/gallon across all cities in the U.S.
 (APU000074714),

 and deflating it with U.S.
 CPI.
 We then estimate the nonlinear model with gasoline consumption series and
 the real price of gasoline as dependent variables.
 Impulse responses in Figure 15 suggest that the real price of gasoline
 and gasoline expenditures respond similarly to a 10% increase in gasoline
 expenditures across recessions and expansions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As gasoline expenditures increase by 10%, gasoline consumed by the transportatio
n sector is 1.02% less than its original level in recessions as opposed to
 0.56% in expansions across the same time period.
 We also estimate the response of total miles traveled to gasoline expenditure
 increases between recessions and expansions.
 Data on miles traveled was downloaded from the Travel Volume Trends released
 by the U.S.
 Federal Highway Administration.
 Estimation of the nonlinear model with total miles traveled as our dependent
 variable suggests a decrease of 1.10% in recessions as opposed to 0.69% in
 expansions.
 As the cost of operating vehicles increases, traffic volume goes down with
 the impact being amplified during recessions.

As gasoline expenditures increase by 10%, residential consumption of gasoline
 increases by 1.94% in expansions while it decreases by 0.47% in recessions
 during the same time period.
 The asymmetric response of gasoline expenditure to its own shock is explained
 by how gasoline consumption responds between recessions and expansions.
 The increased demand for gasoline by the residential sector drives up the
 price of gasoline which then feeds into higher gasoline expenditures in
 expansions.
 On the other hand, the drop in gasoline consumption by the residential
 and transportation sectors in recessions puts a downward pressure on gasoline
 prices and reduces gasoline expenditures.

 Forecasting Implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the U.S.
 was an oil-importer throughout the course of our sample period, higher
 gasoline expenditures caused a transfer of U.S.
 income to foreign oil producers.
 This reduction in disposable income lead to the depression of non-gasoline
 consumption, which is evident from the results of our linear VAR model.
 This paper find that the effect of a gasoline expenditure shock on U.S.
 consumption depends on the state of the economy, with the effect pronounced
 in recessions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis, thus emphasizes the need for the Federal Reserve to consider
 asymmetries in the impact of gasoline expenditure shocks across recessions
 and expansions when it is forecasting consumption or other macro variables,
 as failure to do so might result in misleading conclusions about the effect
 of gasoline expenditures shock on the U.S.
 economy.
 To make this point, we present forecasts of our consumption variables following
 a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures using a model that accounts for
 asymmetries (nonlinear), and a model that doesn't (linear).
 The nonlinear model is,

The upper columns in Figures 17-20 at the end of the paper represent the

 The difference between nonlinear and linear forecasts is represented in
 the lower columns, with a negative value indicating that the effect of
 gasoline expenditure shocks on consumption is underestimated using the
 linear model.
 The red dashed line in Figure 17 represents the forecasts of non-gasoline
 consumption following a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures using the
 linear model, whereas the corresponding solid blue line represents the
 forecasts to the same shock using the nonlinear model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets consider the example of 1979 Q4, our linear model forecast suggests
 that non-gasoline consumption is expected to increase by 0.10% following
 a 10% increase in gasoline expenditures.
 On the other hand, the nonlinear forecast suggests that non-gasoline consumptio
n is expected to decrease by 0.4% in the same quarter.
 The linear model is underestimating the effect of a gasoline expenditure
 shock on non-gasoline consumption by around 0.5% during the last quarter
 of 1979.
 This pattern can be seen throughout our entire sample period with the differenc
e in forecasts being negative, especially during recessions which is represented
 by the shaded areas.
 Because the linear model is nested in the nonlinear model, the forecasts
 for both models are usually the same when the economy is going through
 an an expansion since both the recession dummy 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{T}$
\end_inset

 and interaction term 
\begin_inset Formula $inter_{T}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Referring to Figure 19, the linear model is forecasting spending on nondurables
 to increase by around 0.2%, and decrease by 0.6% based on the nonlinear model
 forecasts during 1990 Q2.
 This suggests that the linear model is underestimating the effect of a
 gasoline expenditure shock on nondurables consumption by a magnitude of
 0.8%.
 A similar difference in forecasts can be seen for other consumption categories,
 i.e.
 durables, and services, throughout the entire sample period.

 Alternative Measure of Recession
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different measures of recessions have been proposed in the literature.
 Ramey and Zubairy (2018), Owyang et.
 al (2013) use unemployment rate to define the state of the economy and
 use 6.5 as the threshold.
 Other measures include NBER recession dates, capacity utilization and output
 gap.
 Hamilton argues that instead of relying on the NBER's subjective judgment
 of the committee members for recessions, it would be a better idea to estimate
 recession probabilities using the data.

See Chauvet and Hamilton (2005) for further information on the advantages
 of using formal quantitative algorithms to identify business cycle turning

 They introduce a measure for dating business cycle turning points namely

quarterly real-time GDP-based recession probability index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This index denotes the probability of recession if all we observe is one
 quarter's GDP growth as a function of the observed rate of GDP.
 Their findings are consistent in simulation with real-time databases.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Since this proposed definition of recessions by Hamilton is entirely mechanical
, we rely on it as an alternative measure to the Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
 (2012) recession dates.
 Hamilton's measure corresponds to the probability that the underlying true
 economic regime is one of recession based on the available data.
 It is calculated in the following manner,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(Recession|GDP)=\frac{P(Recession\bigcap GDP)}{P(GDP)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation gives us the conditional probability of the economy being
 in a recession given the value for GDP growth is observed.
 The numerator gives the joint probability of observing GDP growth and the
 occurrence of a recession, whereas the denominator measures the probability
 of observing the value of GDP growth.

 Real Price of Gasoline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use gasoline prices as an alternative measure of shock to make sure that
 our interpretation of the structural shock to gasoline expenditures is
 accurate.
 Variation in gasoline expenditures could be caused by fluctuations in the
 price of gasoline, changes in vehicle fuel efficiency, changes in the stock
 of vehicles resulting from changes in preferences for larger or smaller
 vehicles, changes in travel patterns as witnessed in the aftermath of the
 9/11 terrorist attacks, and changes in commuting behavior as a response
 to fluctuations in house prices.

A 10% increase in the price of gasoline over the course of a year that leads
 to an increase of $110 in gasoline expenditures across the same time period

 $831.
 Spending on durables, nondurables and services declines by $270, $95 and
 $409 in recessions respectively.
 On the other hand, a 10% increase in the price of gasoline over the course
 of a year that increases gasoline expenditures by $141 during the same
 time period in expansions, will reduce total consumption by $279.
 The drop in expansions for durables is $27, nondurables is $36 and services
 is $108.

 a gasoline expenditures shock is stronger in recessions as opposed to expansion

 Positive versus Negative Shocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also examine whether positive and negative shocks affect consumption
 differently.
 Figure 10 indicates the response of consumption to a 10% decrease in gasoline
 spending.
 A portion of household's income frees up when gasoline expenditures decrease.
 As a result, discretionary income increases since consumers now have more
 to spend on non-gasoline goods and services.
 A 10% decrease in gasoline expenditures increases non-gasoline consumption
 by 2.66% in recessions and 0.65% in expansions.
 This suggests that unanticipated decreases in gasoline expenditures are
 more effective in boosting consumption during recessions.
 Households tend to consume more of the extra income generated during recessions
 as opposed to expansions.

 As oil prices decrease, wealth is transferred away from oil-exporting to
 oil-importing countries (Iacoviello, 2016).
 This result is also in line with the empirical work on the effects of fiscal

 Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inelastic demand for gasoline in the short run translates higher gasoline
 prices into higher gasoline expenditures which causes a shift in consumption
 fron non-gasoline to gasoline goods.
 Since the U.S.
 was a net importer of crude oil from January 1973 through May 2019, increases
 in gasoline expenditures cause a transfer of U.S.
 income to foreign oil producers.
 Thus, higher gasoline expenditures have the same effect as a tax on the
 U.S.
 economy, and should be expected to reduce aggregate consumption.
 The motivation for our analysis comes from the literature showing that
 the impact of fiscal policy depends on the state of the economy.
 This paper investigates the following, i) what happens to consumption when
 gasoline expenditures increase, ii) does the response of consumption to
 gasoline expenditures shock depend on the state of the economy, and iii)
 why does the response of consumption to gasoline expenditures shock differ
 across the state of the economy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present evidence that higher gasoline expenditures reduce spending on
 non-gasoline goods and services considerably.
 Empirical results suggest that when gasoline spending increases by approximatel
y $200 (10% increase in gasoline expenditures) over the course of a year,
 an average household will have to cut down spending on non-gasoline goods
 and services by $389 during the same time period.
 This response is primarily driven by the durables and services sector.
 Our estimation of the nonlinear model suggests the presence of an asymmetric
 response of consumption to gasoline expenditures between states of the
 economy.
 Gasoline expenditure shocks have a stronger effect on non-gasoline consumption
 in recessions as opposed to expansions.
 The asymmetry in the response of consumption over the business cycle is
 driven by the difference in household savings behavior in recessions versus
 expansions.
 Our central estimates are robust to alternate measures of recession and
 shock as well.
 We also explore the response of consumption to gasoline expenditure decreases.
 Our estimates suggest that gasoline expenditure decreases are more effective
 in boosting private consumption during recessions.
 Households consume the extra income generated following unanticipated decreases
 in gasoline expenditures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our paper provides evidence that shocks to gasoline expenditures have the
 same effect as a change in taxes, and if fiscal policy has different effects
 in recessions and expansions, it follows that the effect of a gasoline
 expenditure shock should also depend on the state of the business cycle.
 A finding of economically meaningful nonlinearity of this type requires
 a change to empirical and theoretical macroeconomic models that include
 energy prices.
 The analysis, thus emphasizes the need for the Federal Reserve to consider
 asymmetries in the impact of gasoline expenditure shocks across recessions
 and expansions when it is forecasting consumption or other macro variables,
 as failure to do so might result in misleading conclusions about the effect
 of gasoline expenditures shock on the U.S.
 economy.
 We present forecasts from both linear and nonlinear models, and find that
 the linear model might underestimate the effect of a gasoline expenditure
 shock on consumption which is why it is imperative for the Federal Reserve's
 forecasting models to account for this kind of asymmetry.

: The upper-column indicates the linear and nonlinear consumption forecasts,
 and the lower-column indicates the difference in forecasts with the shaded
 area representing U.S.
 recessions.
 The red dashed line represents the forecast of consumption following a
 10% increase in gasoline expenditures in the same time period using the
 linear model, whereas the solid blue line represents the forecasts of consumpti
on using the nonlinear model.
 The solid line in the lower-column represents the difference in consumption
 forecasts, with a negative value suggesting that the forecasts with the
 linear model are underestimating the effect of a gasoline expenditure shock.
