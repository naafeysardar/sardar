\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I have received two reviews of this paper from experts in this field.
 Both agree that the paper is worthy of investigation and offers a relevant
 contribution to the literature.
 However, both reviewers raise a variety of concerns about the empirical
 methodology and give several other important detailed comments that should
 be addressed in a major revision before the paper is publishable.
 I am looking forward to receiving the revised version of this paper, and
 encourage the authors to respond to all comments of both reviewers.
 An additional suggestion I have is to better frame the paper in a water
 context, so that it has a stronger link with the theme of the journal Water
 Resources and Economics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit the manuscript.
 We have included a paragraph in the introduction that better frames the
 paper in a water context, and through out the paper (where possible), we
 have made efforts to frame the paper to better suit the journal.

\emph on
First of all, the analysis of the ENSO effects is starting from the measure
 of ENSO i.e., SSTA.
 There is no obvious explanation in the manuscript as to why the choice
 of Brunner(2002) to also include the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomalies
 was not considered.
 Clearly in this case, the results become over-complicated but I think this
 should be at least mentioned as a sensitivity analysis.

 We have now made it clearer in the paper on why we focus on the SSTA and
 not on the SOI as the measure of ENSO.
 In the paper, we state that:

While some papers have used the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomalies
 to capture ENSO events, this paper exclusively uses SSTA for several reasons.
 First, the official measure of ENSO used by the NOAA - the Oceanic Niño
 Index (ONI) - is based on sea surface temperatures in the east-central
 tropical Pacific Ocean.
 It is perhaps for this reason that SSTA are the most widely used ENSO indicator
 in academic research (see e.g.
 Hansen et al., 1998; Brunner, 2002; and Berry and Okulicz-Kozaryn, 2008).
 Second, the SOI is calculated as the difference between the atmospheric
 pressure at sea level over Tahiti and over Darwin, Australia.
 As pointed out by the NOAA, the fact that the SOI is derived from sea level
 pressure over just two stations implies that shorter term sea level pressure
 fluctuations not related to ENSO can affect the SOI.

 Third, the two stations over which sea level pressure data are collected
 to estimate the SOI - Tahiti and Darwin - are located south of the equator
 (Tahiti at 18˚S, Darwin at 12˚S).
 ENSO, however, is typically focused closer to the equator.

\begin_layout Standard
As the reviewer notes, results become over-complicated when SOI is used.
 Even though it is an alternative measure of ENSO, it has several drawbacks.
 In addition, note that even though Brunner (2002) also uses SOI, the responses
 of many of the variables in his model to a shock to SOI are not significantly
 different from zero, while the responses to SSTA shocks are different from
 zero.
 Other authors have found similar results when using the SOI.

Following on Brunner(2002) the authors have chosen to include GDP growth
 and CPI inflation rates in their model.
 I think that in the case of Brunner(2002) that was more appropriate than
 in the case of this manuscript.
 Of course this is just an opinion but the dynamics of the stock market
 prices should be better connected with the Fama French Carhart model variables:
 (see Carhart, M.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
As far as the 12 tickers chosen for this analysis, I think that there is
 more information needed in the manuscript as for the motivation of this
 choice.
 As now the manuscript reads, the choice seems unjustified.
 For example, are these the 12 firms listed in the S&P500 index of the agricultu
ral sector (Standard Industrial Classification codes 011 to 019 or all firms
 in the 01 SIC code)? The answer is clear from the firm names if you work
 on this type of data but the readers of this journal would need some more
 information.
 Maybe in a form of a table in the appendix that includes the SIC code of
 each firm and their subgroup.
 This way, for example, the reader will know where Monsanto is active (SIC:
 8731, 2879, 5191 among others) that will help during your interpretation
 of the results.
 Of course during the interpretation the authors introduce most of the informati
on that is important for the reader, yet summarising that information in
 one place is a good practice.

On the same train of thought, even though from the text left and right I
 know that monthly data were used (?) for the analysis, I think that the
 frequency of the data needs to be explicitly mentioned maybe as a sub-text

 On this point, the amount of observations per series needs to be included
 somewhere in the manuscript.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Going now to the ENSO, I cannot help but wonder why 1990 is your starting
 point? If that is because the ticker data are not there you should probably
 mention that in the text so the 1990 does not seem arbitrary to the readers.
 That brings me to Figure 2.
 As we see in the first 5 years we have a prolonged El Niño occurrence (see
 Qian, Cheng, et al.
 "On changing El Niño: A view from time-varying annual cycle, interannual
 variability, and mean state." Journal of Climate 24.24 (2011): 6486-6500).
 I think that some discussion on the matter needs to be included in the
 manuscript concerning the long natural cycles of El Niño and how that might
 affect the results presented in the manuscript.

Last on the data section I truly believe that the S&P500 index used as aggregate
 stock returns could be substituted by the S&P Agribusiness North America
 Index (Ticker: SPAENAUP) that can actually capture better the question
 you are asking.
 The total S&P500 index might be too indifferent to these changes that are
 of interest in this paper.

\begin_layout Standard

Agreed.
 However, we used the S&P 500 to make exactly the point the reviewer just
 made.
 That is, we used the S&P 500 index to show that a broad measure such as
 the S&P 500 might be too indifferent to shocks to ENSO, making it necessary
 to study individual food and agricultural stock returns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, while we would have liked to use the S&P Agribusiness North
 America Index, this index is only available from June 2008.
 After differencing and taking lags into account, estimating an 8-variable
 VAR model with such short time series results in serious degrees of freedom
 issues, making inference impossible.

Your analysis is based on a simple VAR.
 Clearly this methodology is unable to capture the non-linearities in the
 system dynamics as was shown by Ubilava, David, 2017.
 "The ENSO Effect and Asymmetries in Wheat Price Dynamics," World Development,
 Elsevier, vol.
 96(C), pages 490-502.
 The authors do not have to go into the trouble of applying this methodology
 but they should at least mention it in the manuscript.

Response to Comment 7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Agreed.
 A simple VAR model does not capture nonlinearities, to the extent that
 such nonlinearities are present.
 However, using the nonlinear approaches used by, for example, Ubilava (2017)
 are also problematic.
 First, the nonlinear time series literature suggests a host of nonlinear
 methods.
 In the end, whichever method one chooses is somewhat arbitrary.
 For example one could choose to model these nonlinearities using Threshold
 VAR models, Smooth Transition models, Regime Switching models, etc.
 There is no theory as to which nonlinear alternative is most appropriate,
 especially for a study like ours.
 Second, with these nonlinear methods, the usual impulse response functions
 and forecast error variance decomposition will no longer be applicable.
 As a result, we have rewritten the manuscript to focus on the main results
 from the linear VAR model, leaving the question of possible nonlinearities
 for future research.
 This has been mentioned in the conclusion of the paper.

As far as the lags used in the VAR, I am a bit surprised about the result
 of k=1 but of course that can be a result of the two criteria used here.
 Nevertheless, these tests are just to give some guidance.
 As a rule of thumb, I would always start with 12 lags in the case of monthly
 data in long series in order to cover seasonality.
 Does that change the results significantly?

 In the baseline results, we selected the lag length using the SIC which
 selected 3 lags.
 In a robustness section, we estimated the VAR models using 12 lags of the
 endogenous variables.
 As shown in Figure 6 of the revised manuscript, the results are quite robust
 to alternative lag lengths.

Comment 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The paper does not include a discussion on the determinants of U.S.
 stock returns.
 As is well known, in the literature there are three recognized determinants
 of stock market returns, namely inflation, inflation uncertainty, and foreign
 exchange rate.
 Even though the paper considers inflation, theory indicates that higher
 inflation is caused by higher inflation uncertainty, with the direction
 of causality going from inflation uncertainty to inflation.
 Thus, the assumed relation is between inflation uncertainty, and not inflation,
 and stock returns as the author states.
 This is due to the fact that higher inflation uncertainty increases the
 required risk premium, lead to a higher discount rate, and lowers the discounte
d present value of expected future cash flows, thus resulting in a fall
 in stock prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Regarding the relation between U.S.
 stock returns and the U.S.
 dollar, there is a theoretical justification for a link between stock returns
 and the foreign exchange rate.
 A depreciation of the foreign exchange rate makes export-oriented firms
 more competitive and they generate more profits from international trade.
 Therefore, since stock returns are equal to discounted future cash flows,
 and since higher earnings mean higher cash flows, then stock returns are
 positively impacted.
 Nonetheless, such a relationship breaks down, and changes sign, if firms
 are imported oriented, relying on foreign inputs into their production
 process.
 In such a case, a depreciation of the foreign exchange rate raises the
 cost of inputs and reduce profits, lowering stock prices.
 In both cases, the causality runs from the foreign exchange rate to the
 stock prices.
 Therefore, the author must include on the model the foreign exchange rate
 to check the robustness of his results.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Unit root tests indicated that ENSO measures are I(0) whereas the macroeconomic
 and stock prices are I(1) in log levels and I(0) in log first differences.
 Without showing that there is no evidence of cointegration among the variables
 in log levels, the author decides to estimate equation (2) as a VAR in
 first differences.
 However, this approach would be suboptimal if it was determined these series
 are indeed cointegrated.
 In that case, the VAR would only express the short-run responses of these
 series to innovations in each series.
 If the series are cointegrated, they move together in the long-run.
 A VAR in first differences, although properly specified in terms of covariance-
stationary series, will not capture those long-run tendencies.
 The author must show evidence of no cointegration among the variables in
 log levels; otherwise, model (2) must include an error correction term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Response to Comment 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The finding that some variables are stationary in levels, while others are
 stationary only after first differences rules out the need to test for
 cointegration.
 Testing for cointegration is only necessary if all the variables potentially
 entering the VAR model contain a unit root.
 As Table 3 shows, this is not the case for all our variables, hence, a
 VAR model in differences is appropriate.

\begin_layout Standard

Strictly speaking, model 2 is a recursive VAR, where the variables are assumed
 to form a recursive dynamic structural model where each variable only depends
 upon those above it in the vector.
 On the other hand, a structural VAR is where theory is used to place restrictio
ns on the contemporaneous correlations.
 The author must be careful using the structural VAR concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In the dynamic structural equation model (equation 2), the ordering of the
 recursive structure is that imposed in the Cholesky decomposition, which
 is that in which the endogenous variables appear in the model estimation.
 As this choice is somewhat arbitrary, the author must explore the impulse
 response functions from a different ordering to check for results robustness.

We have provided evidence in the paper that results remain unchanged when
 we estimate the VAR models with the reverse ordering of the variables.
 Of course, this ordering is simply to ensure robustness of the results,
 but is not very meaningful, as it is, for example, unlikely that agricultural
 stock returns affect ENSO contemporaneously.
 The main results of the paper follow the convention of ordering the more
 exogenous variables ahead of the less exogenous ones.

\begin_layout Standard

The author conjecture that responses to ENSO shocks are asymmetric- a strong
 el Niño event may result in stock returns dynamics very different than
 those associated with a strong la Niña event.
 This latter observation suggests that standard linear models including
 Vector Autoregression (VAR) or Vector Error Corrections Models (VECMs)
 may not be appropriated for examining asymmetric relationships between
 ENSO events and agriculture stock returns.
 Therefore, equation (2) must be extended to a nonlinear alternative model
 such as the Smooth Transition Autoregression (STAR) model or the Markov-Switchi
ng Vector Autoregression model.
 (See, for instance, Ubilava D.
 and Holt M.
 (2013).
 El niño southern oscillation and its effects on world vegetable oil prices:

 The Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics; for the
 use of nonlinear models).
 Otherwise, the author must explain how the use of the VAR model on subsamples
 address regime-dependent asymmetries on the nonlinear relationship between
 ENSO shocks and stock returns.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have refocused the paper on the main effects of ENSO, leaving out the
 question of possible asymmetries/nonlinearities for future research.
 The reviewer is absolutely right that if ENSO has asymmetric or nonlinear
 effects, then a simple linear VAR model estimated over different subsamples
 does not address the issue of regime dependence across subsamples.
 However, the nonlinear time series approaches are also problematic.
 First, the nonlinear time series literature suggests a host of nonlinear
 methods, including Threshold VAR models, Smooth Transition (Vector) Autoregress
ive models, Markov Switching State Space models, and the subcategories of
 these models.
 The issue then becomes suppose we test for linearity against a variety
 of possible nonlinear alternatives.
 In most cases, a rejection of linearity does not tell the researcher which
 nonlinear specification is most appropriate.
 In that case, choosing a given nonlinear alternative is just as arbitrary
 as the VAR model.
 In addition, with these nonlinear methods, the usual impulse response functions
 and forecast error variance decomposition will no longer be applicable.
 As a result, we have rewritten the manuscript to focus on the main results
 from the linear VAR model, leaving the question of possible nonlinearities
 for future research.
 This has been mentioned in the conclusion of the paper.
